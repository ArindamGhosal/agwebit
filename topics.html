        <p>Cryptography is the study and practice of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. <br>It deals with developing and analyzing protocols that prevents malicious third parties from retrieving information being shared between two entities thereby following the various aspects of information security. <br>Secure Communication refers to the scenario where the message or data shared between two parties can’t be accessed by an adversary.<br> In Cryptography, an Adversary is a malicious entity, which aims to retrieve precious information or data thereby undermining the principles of information security.<br> Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Non-repudiation are core principles of modern-day cryptography.
            <br>

            Confidentiality refers to certain rules and guidelines usually executed under confidentiality agreements which ensure that the information is restricted to certain people or places.<br>
            Data integrity refers to maintaining and making sure that the data stays accurate and consistent over its entire life cycle.<br>
            Authentication is the process of making sure that the piece of data being claimed by the user belongs to it.<br>
            Non-repudiation refers to the ability to make sure that a person or a party associated with a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature over their document or the sending of a message.<br>
        
        Consider two parties Alice and Bob. <br>Now, Alice wants to send a message m to Bob over a secure channel. <br>So, what happens is as follows. <br>The sender’s message or sometimes called the Plaintext, is converted into an unreadable form using a Key k.<br> The resultant text obtained is called the Ciphertext.<br> This process is known as Encryption.<br> At the time of received, the Ciphertext is converted back into the plaintext using the same Key k, so that it can be read by the receiver.<br> This process is known as Decryption.
        
        Alice (Sender)       Bob (Receiver)
        C = E (m, k)  ---->    m = D (C, k) 
        
        Here, C refers to the Ciphertext while E and D are the Encryption and Decryption algorithms respectively.<br> Let’s consider the case of Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher as an example.<br> As the name suggests, in Caesar’s Cipher each character in a word is replaced by another character under some defined rules.<br> Thus, if A is replaced by D, B by E and so on.<br> Then, each character in the word would be shifted by a position of 3.<br> For example:
        
        Plaintext : Geeksforgeeks<br>
        Ciphertext : Jhhnvirujhhnv </p>

        he Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

DES is an implementation of a Feistel Cipher. It uses 16 round Feistel structure. The block size is 64-bit. Though, key length is 64-bit, DES has an effective key length of 56 bits, since 8 of the 64 bits of the key are not used by the encryption algorithm (function as check bits only). General Structure of DES is depicted in the following illustration −

Since DES is based on the Feistel Cipher, all that is required to specify DES is −

Round function
Key schedule
Any additional processing − Initial and final permutation
Initial and Final Permutation
The initial and final permutations are straight Permutation boxes (P-boxes) that are inverses of each other. They have no cryptography significance in DES. The initial and final permutations are shown as follows −
